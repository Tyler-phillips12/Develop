# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

## Introduction
Welcome to this regex tutorial! In this tutorial, we will explore a regular expression for matching email addresses. Regex, short for regular expressions, is a powerful tool for pattern matching. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how the regular expression for matching an email works and how to use it effectively.

## Summary
The regular expression we will be focusing on is: `^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$`. This regex pattern is designed to validate email addresses and ensure they follow the correct format.

## Anchors
The `^` and `$` characters are anchors used in the regular expression. The `^` anchor signifies the start of the string, while the `$` anchor signifies the end. In the context of matching an email, these anchors ensure that the email address is the complete string and not just a part of it.

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers determine the number of times a character or group should occur. In our regex, the `+` quantifier specifies that the preceding character or group should occur one or more times. This is useful for matching multiple characters in the username and domain name parts of the email address.

## OR Operator
The OR operator (`|`) allows us to match one pattern or another. Although not explicitly used in the email matching regex, understanding the OR operator is essential for building more complex regular expressions.

## Character Classes
Character classes allow us to specify a set of characters to match from. In the email regex, we use character classes to define the allowed characters in the username and domain name parts.

## Flags
Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regular expression matching. While the email regex does not use any flags, it's important to know how flags can affect pattern matching in other scenarios.

## Grouping and Capturing
Groups in regular expressions are used to capture and extract specific parts of the matched pattern. In the email regex, we have groups for the username, domain name, and top-level domain.

## Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions, also known as character ranges, allow us to specify a range of characters to match. Although not directly used in the email regex, understanding bracket expressions is beneficial for more advanced regular expressions.

## Greedy and Lazy Match
Regular expressions are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. However, we can make them lazy by using the `?` quantifier. This section will explore greedy and lazy matching in the context of email regex.

## Boundaries
Boundaries help us define the start or end of a word or line. While not utilized in the email regex, understanding boundaries is crucial for building regular expressions that match specific word patterns.

## Back-references
Back-references allow us to match a previously captured group again. In the email regex, we don't use back-references, but they are essential in more complex matching scenarios.

## Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions allow us to assert that a pattern should (or should not) be followed by another pattern, without including it in the actual match. While not used in the email regex, these assertions are powerful tools for advanced pattern matching.
